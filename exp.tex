We run our dataset on LR, Random Forest, SVM and XGBOOST respectively, along with the features mentioned above added into time frame based models.
\begin{table}[htbp]
	\caption{Evaluation results on different models}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
			\hline
			Model & Accuracy\\
			\hline
			LR & 60.9\%\\
			\hline
			SVM & 68.9\%\\
			\hline
			Random Forest & 70.1\%\\
			\hline
			XGBOOST & 73.6\%\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\label{tab2}
	\end{center}
\end{table}
Table.\ref{tab2} shows the prediction accuracy of different models. We can see that they can all perform well based on our settings, and XGBOOST achieves the most favourable result.
